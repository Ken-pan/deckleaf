# Data and privacy

Decksprig is a personal open-source project maintained by Ken Pan. This describes version 0.1.0, released on 14 October 2026. Ken Pan operates the official demonstration at https://decksprig.kens-toolbox.com, hosted by Netlify. For a privacy question, use https://github.com/Ken-pan/decksprig/issues without personal data; request a private contact route before sharing sensitive details. Other hosts must identify their own operator and practices.

Local editing requires no account. The Node edition stores documents, history and imported originals in `.data` on your computer. The browser edition stores documents and history in IndexedDB; settings, recovery drafts and preferences also use browser storage. Export a Deck JSON backup before clearing site data. Use the document library to delete documents; deleting a working document does not erase separately retained imported originals or your exported backups. Remove the corresponding local copies yourself when you no longer need them.

| Optional action | What leaves the device |
| --- | --- |
| AI connection, model listing or proposal generation | Credentials to your selected provider; selected document context, prompts and relevant tool results. Proposal requests are optional. Provider retention depends on that provider and account settings; `store:false` is not a promise of zero logging |
| Open photo search or image import | Search terms, requested resource IDs and normal connection information to the configured photo proxy and source/CDN |
| Server-configured Unsplash/Pexels search | Search terms to that provider. Developer credentials remain on the local server; the browser edition has no developer-key input |
| Online fonts | Font search/download requests to the font source; ordinary editing uses bundled/local fonts |
| Figma or Google source import/export | The selected source identifiers, tokens and requested files to the respective service; cloud changes require an explicit export/publish action |
| Prototype, remote image or presentation sharing | Requests to the referenced host; remote embeds may use their own cookies and collect viewer information |

There is no project analytics SDK or automatic document upload in this source release. The official demo has no document backend and its optional photo-search proxy is disabled. Netlify/CDN access logs can still include IP addresses and request paths. Hosting processing is subject to [Netlify’s privacy policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/). This project has no application access-log database and cannot independently verify or promise Netlify’s log retention. A self-hosting operator controls their retention and deletion, and must document these before offering a public service. The repository cannot delete a third-party provider's logs or independently verify its retention.

AI credentials stay in session memory or server environment configuration, not in documents or Git. Some OAuth/API workflows use local user configuration outside the repository. Don't publish those files. Before sharing a Deck file, review source URLs, speaker notes, hidden slides, image metadata, embedded fonts and reference renders: they can contain personal or confidential material.

For source-project questions use this repository's issue tracker without personal documents or credentials. For a privacy request about a hosted copy, contact that copy's operator. This project has no commercial support or retention SLA.
